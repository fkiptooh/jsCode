DOM MANIPULATION Assignment
Create a simple webpage that displays a list of items and allows the user to add and remove items from the list using DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript.

The webpage should have the following elements:
A header with a title for the page.
A section for the list of items.
An input field where the user can type in a new item to add to the list.
A button to add the new item to the list.
Each item in the list should have a delete button to remove it from the list.
The webpage should use JavaScript to dynamically update the list of items when the user adds or removes an item. Here are some tips for how to implement this:

Use the document.createElement() method to create new list items and buttons.
Use the appendChild() method to add the new list items and buttons to the list.
Use the addEventListener() method to attach click event listeners to the add and delete buttons.
Use the parentNode and removeChild() methods to remove items from the list.
